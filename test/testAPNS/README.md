## About APNS test Example:

As to use this service, Apple requires you to be an enrolled iOS Developer or something similar, you can test the API with a local server.
This server was taken from: [3](http://bravenewmethod.wordpress.com/2013/04/20/test-server-for-apple-push-notification-and-feedback-integration/). It simulates the APNS servers and I modified it to test different common scenes.
